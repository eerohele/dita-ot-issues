dita-ot-issues
==============

A set of fixtures for testing DITA-OT issues.

### Basic use

In most cases, provided that your `DITA_GIT` environment variable points to the
[DITA-OT Git repository][dita-ot], to generate output for a given issue, you
should be able to just do something like:

```bash
cd fixtures/1173
ant -find
```

The Ant buildfile in this repository should be able to build pretty much any
DITA file regardless of the DITA-OT version you're using. You don't need to set
the `CLASSPATH`, either â€” in fact, it's probably better if it's empty. If it
doesn't work, though, please let me know.

A default set of properties passed to DITA-OT is defined in the
`build.properties` file in the root of this repository.

To locate your DITA-OT installation, the buildfile uses your `DITA_GIT`
environment variable. You can tell it to use another DITA-OT installation by
doing:

```bash
ant -Ddita.home=/path/to/dita-ot ...
```

By default, the buildfile looks for a DITA map called `root.ditamap` in the
directory where you run `ant`. If your DITA file has another name, you'll have
to tell that to the buildfile.

There's two ways to do that. The buildfile reads the `build.properties` file in
the current directory and passes the properties in that file to DITA-OT. So, if
a specific set of DITA properties needs to be set for an issue to occur, you can add them into the `build.properties` file for that issue.

That means that to specify the name of your DITA file, you can add a
`build.properties` file like this into the directory of the issue you're working on:

```
args.input = ${user.dir}/indirect-keyref-test.ditamap
```

Or you can specify a different transtype than the default one:

```
transtype = pdf2
```

Or you can set any other DITA-OT property that you need to.

After that, a simple `ant -find` is enough to build the document.

You can also pass any DITA-OT properties as command-line arguments as you
normally would:

```bash
cd fixtures/1605
ant -Dargs.input=$PWD/indirect-keyref-test.ditamap -Dtranstype=pdf2 -find
# On Windows, use %CD% instead of $PWD
```

You can even specify which DITA-OT Ant targets to execute. For example, to only
run the DITA-OT preprocessing stage, into `build.properties`, add:

```
ant.targets = build-init preprocess
```

Or, on the command line:

```bash
ant -Ddost.ant.targets="build-init preprocess" -find
```

**NOTE**: The parameter is `ant.targets` in `build.properties` and
`dost.ant.targets` on the command line because of Ant's property prefix magic.

## Using Vagrant

To use the Vagrantfile in this repo, you must:

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
2. Install [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).
3. Clone the [DITA-OT Git repository](https://github.com/dita-ot/dita-ot)
4. Set the `DITA_GIT` environment variable to point to the directory where you
   cloned the DITA-OT Git repository.

After that, you can run DITA-OT in the Vagrant virtual machine:

1. `cd` to where you have this repo cloned
2. Run `vagrant up`.
3. Run `vagrant ssh`.
4. In the guest machine, run `cd /vagrant`.

You can then build the fixtures:

```
cd /vagrant/fixtures/1173
ant -find
```

No need to set `DITA_HOME` with Vagrant: provided that you have the `DITA_GIT`
environment variable set, it will be set for you automatically in the virtual
machine.
